# Mean_Shift_tracking
Nowadays there are many tracking applications for things, people, objects, etc with different objectives. In this work, we are interested in understanding how the tracking mechanisms and the theory behind this process work for a very particular tracking algorithm: the Mean Shift, introduced by Comaniciu et al. This method has been explained in class and in this work we will deal with it in depth. We will apply it for persons, but also for objects. The algorithm will be implemented in real time on already recorded videos
to test its functionality and performance. The first step will be to define what the Mean Shift algorithm is, we will explain the theory behind this method and then we will show the our implementationâ€™s results by displaying several frames of the video with the algorithm applied to assess its performance.
